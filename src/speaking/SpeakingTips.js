      <h2 className='title'>6 Easy German Speaking Tips for Beginners</h2>
      <p className='introparag'>1. Speak Along with Audiobooks</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        Audiobooks are a great resource for practicing your listening skills. To
        take this up a notch, though, you should start speaking along with them.
        That way, both your listening and speaking skills get a workout! If you
        have the book handy, you can use that as a script so that you don’t miss
        any of the lines. Ideally, you want to get to the point where you don’t
        need to read along. One way to perfect your speaking is to rewind any
        sections which you find particularly difficult. By doing this over and
        over again, you’ll find that you really start to ace your pronunciation!

      <p className='introparag'>2. Find a German Tandem Partner</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        Of course, there’s no better way to practice speaking than by actually
        putting it to good use. And you can do that if you find a German tandem
        partner. The idea with tandem partnerships is that your partner will
        speak in their native language, German, if you use your English with
        them as well. Then the two of you both benefit from joining up. Many
        language schools and programs can help you find a tandem partner, but
        there are also websites where you can find one. In many cases, the idea
        is to meet up face-to-face, but you can also start chatting online with
        your new German-speaking friends through services like Skype if you’re
        having difficulty teaming up with someone in person.
      </p>
      <p className='introparag'>3. Watch People Speak German</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        Watching other people speak German isn’t quite as silly as it may sound.
        It gives you a chance to really focus on the speaker’s mouth and watch
        how they use their lips and tongue to make every sound, which is a great
        way of picking up pronunciation. There are various ways you can watch
        people speak German. For example, you can stream some fantastic German,
        Austrian and Swiss movies and TV shows on Netflix.
      </p>
      <p className='introparag'>4. Practice Listening</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        If you expose yourself to a lot of different sounds that are commonly
        used in the German language, you’ll pick them up a lot more quickly and
        you’ll be able to use them yourself sooner. To turn this into an active
        exercise, you should make a note of any words or phrases that you don’t
        really understand. Keep a vocab list of these words and continue
        reviewing them until you’ve learned them and can correctly pronounce
        them. You can get in your listening practice by watching the types of
        videos mentioned above, but you should also listen to plenty of German
        music and watch German movies.
      </p>
      <p className='introparag'>5. Talk to Yourself</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        If you have no one else to talk to, you should just try talking to
        yourself! The only downside to this is that you need to keep both sides
        of the conversation going! This is especially useful if you’ve just
        learned some new vocabulary or phrases. By repeating them to yourself in
        the context of longer sentences, they’ll stay fresher in your mind for
        longer. Eventually, they’ll stick and you’ll remember them for good!
      </p>
      <p className='introparag'>6. Don’t Be Shy</p>
      <p className='introparag'>
        Finally, it’s important to point out that you shouldn’t be shy when you
        practice your German. You need to be as confident as you can be! It’s
        crucial that you use your spoken German as often as you can, and being
        shy will get in the way of you doing that. Don’t worry, though; you’ll
        naturally grow in confidence the more you use your German. Once you
        start speaking it, you may surprise yourself with just how much you
        know! The best way to build your confidence in your speaking skills is
        to use them regularly. If you start to follow some of the tips that I’ve
        mentioned in this blog, then confidence will come naturally. Not only
        that, but you’ll be continually exposing yourself to more and more
        German, which means your language skills will also flourish!
      </p>

        Hopefully, these tips will have gotten you all pumped up and ready to
        use your German speaking skills!
