          When it comes to listening to and understanding German, most beginners
          struggle. They hear the few words they know. And the rest just fly in
          one ear and out the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, you’re going to learn about 3 tactics that are
          guaranteed to sharpen your listening comprehension skills!
        </p>
        <p>1. Try Our Listening Comprehension Series</p>
        <p>
          This is a complete lesson series dedicated purely to testing and
          improving your listening skills. You can find all of the videos from
          this series in the “Bonus Video Lessons” section of our site! In the
          video lesson, you’ll hear a dialogue in your target language. Then,
          you’ll be asked to answer a question about the dialogue to check if
          you understood the sentences. There are no translations except for the
          subtitles, so everything you hear is in your target language!
        </p>
        <p>2. Review The Dialogue Again And Again</p>
        <p>
          Most learners listen to a listen and simply move on, but by reviewing
          it again, you make sure that you fully understand what you hear. The
          key to fully understanding a dialogue is to review it over and over
          again. With our audio lessons, you get the dialogue track so you can
          listen to the conversation without distractions.
        </p>
        <p>3. Read Along With Our Line-By-Line Feature</p>
        <p>
          Reading along is the best way to get the meaning instantly. With the
          Line-by-Line feature, or the PDF lesson notes, reading along is easier
          than ever! You can get the transcript of the dialogue in the target
          language, the transliterated version, or the translated version. This
          is available for all of the lessons in this series!
        </p>
        <p>
          With these 3 tactics, you’re sure to improve your listening
          comprehension skills and get one step closer to your language learning
          goals!
